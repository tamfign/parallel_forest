        Runs a rough C45 algorithm. 

        In pseudocode, the general algorithm for building decision trees is:

        1. Check for base cases
        2. For each attribute a
            3. Find the normalized information gain ratio from splitting on a
        4. Let a_best be the attribute with the highest normalized information gain
        5. Create a decision node that splits on a_best
        6. Recur on the sublists obtained by splitting on a_best, and add those nodes as children of node
